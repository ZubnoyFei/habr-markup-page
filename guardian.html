<h1>Spooky shipwrecks and singing sands: 10 of the UK’s weirdest beaches</h1>
<p>Expect the unexpected on these UK shores that go against the grain</p>

<p>In about 1628 Mrs Thomasin Farrer, resident of Scarborough, made an incredible discovery: the town had a beach.
    Observant folk had previously noticed these distinctive sandy features of a coastal nature, but dismissed them as
    awful places where ships ran aground and monsters got washed up. They were wastelands.</p>

<p>Thomasin’s genius was to see them differently. Under Scarborough’s South Cliff she had discovered a bubbling spring
    that allegedly cured many ailments, a conclusion soon backed up by many learned physicians (all with practices in
    the town, coincidentally). As the venue for this fount of restorative goodness, the beach and sea were obviously
    health-giving, too.</p>

<blockquote>Women in comfortable shoes pose as wardens on bicycles. It’s all very Midsomer Murders, and extremely
    weird
</blockquote>
<p>By 1720, when Daniel Defoe pitched up, the trickle of sickly visitors had become a tidal wave. By 1735, hotels and
    bathing huts were transforming Scarborough into Great Britain’s first seaside resort. But even more significant, the
    beach had gone from unwanted dumping ground to pleasure park. Almost four centuries later, we still go down to the
    beach. Fashions, however, don’t stand still. The simple Thomasin beach of therapeutic water, sun and sand is fading
    away like a cheap fake tan. In the words of writer Marriott Edgar, concerning an infamous trip to Blackpool in The
    Lion and Albert:</p>
<i>They didn’t think much to the ocean
    The waves they was piddlin’ and small
    There was no wrecks and nobody drowneded
    ’Fact, nothin’ to laugh at at all!</i>
<p>Like Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom in the poem, we want more from our beaches, not a drowning of course, but something
    unexpected and marvellous, like a shipwreck or a washed-up monster. With all due respect to our long coasts, a
    swathe of sand and a few piddlin’ waves is no longer good enough: what is needed is weird and wonderful wilderness.
    Fortunately, in Britain we have some classics: beaches that are unusual, even downright strange, places that require
    exploration.</p>

<h2>Orford Ness, Suffolk</h2>
<img src="img/Orford%20Ness%20National%20Nature%20Reserve%20with%20Orford%20Castle%20and%20River%20Ore%20in%20the%20background..webp"
     alt="Orford Ness National Nature Reserve with Orford Castle and River Ore in the background">
<p>On the face of it, Orford Ness is merely a long spit of shingle, notable for its flora and fauna. Hares and deer can
    be spotted gadding about the horned poppies and sea figs. Distressingly, gangs of ought-to-know-better fly-tippers
    have plonked a load of old concrete bunkers everywhere, plus large quantities of rusting iron. As if this wasn’t bad
    enough, the scabby concrete silos have attracted plagues of installation artists, conspiracy theorists and heritage
    experts who claim the scattered ruins are national treasures, relics of several top secret cold-war-era projects,
    rather than ugly mess. To deter curious tourists, the National Trust has made the place accessible only by a small
    ferry which must be booked on a Thursday (no kidding), and erected warning signs about bombs. Unexplained men in
    sunglasses gather along the designated walkways. Women in comfortable shoes pose as wardens on bicycles. It’s all
    very Midsomer Murders, and extremely weird. Visit with caution.</p>

<p><b>Cafe:</b> You would think the National Trust might open a 1950s-themed outlet on the Ness where Victoria sponge
    cake made
    with radioactive raspberry jam is washed down with dishwater tea, but no, you must return to Orford for
    refreshments. <a href="https://www.riversidetearoomorford.co.uk/">The Riverside Tearoom</a> does superior paninis,
    toasties and cakes.</p>

<h2>Danes Dyke, Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire</h2>
<img src="img/The%20smooth%20white%20‘hag-stones’%20of%20Danes%20Dyke%20beach,%20East%20Yorkshire.webp" alt="The smooth white ‘hag-stones’ of Danes Dyke beach">
<p>From a car park tucked away in deep woods, you wander down a steep-sided declivity that looks suspiciously man-made.
    It was. But no one knows who did it. Was it built to defend against Scandinavian visitors in horned helmets, or part
    of a bronze age northern powerhouse scheme? Whoever was responsible, they cleverly hid the evidence under woodland
    carpeted with wild garlic and bluebells. Then, quite abruptly, you emerge on a marvellous beach, one entirely made
    up of smooth white stones the majority of which have been pierced by one or two finger-size holes. Ignorant and
    illiterate peasants of yesteryear used to blame witches for this, and call the petrified artefacts hag-stones.
    However, since witches no longer exist, we have no explanation. Baffled scientists stand around, looking baffled.
    Children like to balance them in towers (I mean the stones). Leaving aside superstition, it is a fact that you
    cannot tell a lie when speaking through one of the holes in a hag-stone.
    <b>Cafe:</b> There is a good refreshment kiosk near the car park. Otherwise head for Scrumdiddlyumptious in
    Flamborough for
    top-notch cakes.

<h2>Skrinkle Haven, Pembrokeshire</h2>
<img src="img/Church%20Doors,%20the%20dramatic%20natural%20arch%20at%20Skrinkle%20Haven%20in%20Pembrokeshire%20national%20park.webp" alt="The Church doors">
<p>
    Just because UFOs are infrequently sighted in Pembrokeshire doesn’t mean this stretch of coast isn’t weird. Eight
    kilometres west of Tenby is a wonderful and inexplicable beach. Take the long flight of steps down the cliff and you
    arrive in Church Doors, named after its pair of sea stacks that you can swim through when the tide is right. So far,
    so normal. But in the cliff face you will see a small cave entrance that turns out to be a tunnel, leading through
    to Skrinkle Haven’s sandy beach. This geological feature just happens to be the precise length of an alien landing
    craft.
</p>
<p>
    Once on the other side, there is an isolated beach accessible only by that one tunnel (except at low tide when you
    can simply walk round). South Pembrokeshire has several other contenders too: the sands on Barafundle have coughed
    up a shipwreck in recent years, but first prize goes to the inaccessible coves west of Stackpole where the ardent
    abseiler or keen kayaker will discover some very spooky caves indeed.
    <b>Cafe:</b> <a href="https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-manorbier">YHA Manorbier</a> has the excellent Skrinkle
    Tearoom.

<h2>Sandwood Bay, Sutherland</h2>
<img src="img/Sandwood%20Bay%20in%20Sutherland.webp" alt="SAndwood bay in Sutherland">
<p>The opportunity to be eaten alive by monsters is one that most savvy travellers welcome, and few British beaches can
    offer such a guarantee as Sandwood Bay. Hike the four miles across heathery hills to this idyllic stretch of sand on
    a cloudy summer’s day and you are basically serving yourself up as a feast for the legendary vampire of the Scottish
    west coast: the midge. However, like Dracula, these bloodsuckers do hate bright sunshine and strong winds so, with
    luck, can be avoided. On a good day this beach is a miracle of car- and boat-free beauty. Down one end is Am
    Buachaille seastack, a tower of stony silence; at the other, when I visited, was the body of a dead whale. What more
    could anyone want? Take head nets, wild camp near the dunes, and pretend you have it to yourself… but you probably
    won’t because newspapers keep mentioning the place.
    <b>Cafe:</b> Take a stove and cafetière.</p>

<h2>Seaham, County Durham</h2>
<img src="img/A%20glass%20bead%20–%20a%20century-old%20relic.webp" alt="The glass bleed">
<p>
    Vane Tempest beach is a short walk north of Seaham, a sand-and-shingle stretch backed by earthy cliffs. And there
    ends the normality. On any sunny morning you will spot zombies, lots of them, shuffling at a snail’s pace in aimless
    circles, eyes on the ground. Occasionally an oncoming wave will jerk them comically into life and they will prance,
    as if operated by an invisible puppet master, for a few seconds. When approached they can be friendly, claiming to
    be hunting for glass beads, and not part of a zombie flesheater invasion. During the 19th century Seaham became a
    bottle-producing town, and for decades all the broken glass was dumped offshore. After years of rolling in the deep,
    the glass is transformed into beads and washed up, only to be pounced upon by collectors from all over the world (on
    my own visit I met visitors from Lithuania, New Zealand, Italy and Sunderland). Once your eye is attuned, you can
    pick up a bead every few minutes: most common are clear glass nuggets, but blue and red are the most prized. It’s
    great fun and if you set the children on it, they’ll zombie-walk for hours without complaining.
    <b> Cafe</b>: Seaham has a good selection. <a href="https://humblescafebistro.co.uk/">Cafe Humbles</a> is excellent.

<h2>Tusker Rock and Traeth Mawr, Glamorgan</h2>
<img src="img/Traeth%20Mawr%20offers%20tidal%20pools%20and%20fossils.webp" alt="The sunset and the bay">
<p>Travellers go far and wide to see a shipwreck on a beach, but what about a beach made of shipwrecks? The drawback is
    that Tusker Rock is over a mile off Ogmore-by-Sea and accessible only by experienced kayakers: most other boats try
    and avoid it. This deadly outcrop has claimed so many ships over the centuries that its surface is largely made of
    twisted metal and boiler plates from various 19th-century wrecks. Fortunately, there are interesting beaches nearby,
    although you do still need to check the tides for Traeth Mawr, a wonderful long, cliff-backed strand with tidal
    pools and fossils. As you head north-west, you might spot a mermaid – no, hang on, that’s a naturist. They do hang
    out around here.
    <b>Cafe</b>: <a href="https://www.ploughandharrowmonknash.co.uk/">The Plough and Harrow</a> at Monknash is nearest
    and best. Cider is a speciality.</p>
