<h1>Spooky shipwrecks and singing sands: 10 of the UK’s weirdest beaches</h1>
<p>Expect the unexpected on these UK shores that go against the grain</p>

<p>In about 1628 Mrs Thomasin Farrer, resident of Scarborough, made an incredible discovery: the town had a beach.
    Observant folk had previously noticed these distinctive sandy features of a coastal nature, but dismissed them as
    awful places where ships ran aground and monsters got washed up. They were wastelands.</p>

<p>Thomasin’s genius was to see them differently. Under Scarborough’s South Cliff she had discovered a bubbling spring
    that allegedly cured many ailments, a conclusion soon backed up by many learned physicians (all with practices in
    the town, coincidentally). As the venue for this fount of restorative goodness, the beach and sea were obviously
    health-giving, too.</p>

<blockquote>Women in comfortable shoes pose as wardens on bicycles. It’s all very Midsomer Murders, and extremely
    weird
</blockquote>
<p>By 1720, when Daniel Defoe pitched up, the trickle of sickly visitors had become a tidal wave. By 1735, hotels and
    bathing huts were transforming Scarborough into Great Britain’s first seaside resort. But even more significant, the
    beach had gone from unwanted dumping ground to pleasure park. Almost four centuries later, we still go down to the
    beach. Fashions, however, don’t stand still. The simple Thomasin beach of therapeutic water, sun and sand is fading
    away like a cheap fake tan. In the words of writer Marriott Edgar, concerning an infamous trip to Blackpool in The
    Lion and Albert:</p>
<i>They didn’t think much to the ocean
    The waves they was piddlin’ and small
    There was no wrecks and nobody drowneded
    ’Fact, nothin’ to laugh at at all!</i>
<p>Like Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom in the poem, we want more from our beaches, not a drowning of course, but something
    unexpected and marvellous, like a shipwreck or a washed-up monster. With all due respect to our long coasts, a
    swathe of sand and a few piddlin’ waves is no longer good enough: what is needed is weird and wonderful wilderness.
    Fortunately, in Britain we have some classics: beaches that are unusual, even downright strange, places that require
    exploration.</p>

<h2>Orford Ness, Suffolk</h2>
<p>On the face of it, Orford Ness is merely a long spit of shingle, notable for its flora and fauna. Hares and deer can
    be spotted gadding about the horned poppies and sea figs. Distressingly, gangs of ought-to-know-better fly-tippers
    have plonked a load of old concrete bunkers everywhere, plus large quantities of rusting iron. As if this wasn’t bad
    enough, the scabby concrete silos have attracted plagues of installation artists, conspiracy theorists and heritage
    experts who claim the scattered ruins are national treasures, relics of several top secret cold-war-era projects,
    rather than ugly mess. To deter curious tourists, the National Trust has made the place accessible only by a small
    ferry which must be booked on a Thursday (no kidding), and erected warning signs about bombs. Unexplained men in
    sunglasses gather along the designated walkways. Women in comfortable shoes pose as wardens on bicycles. It’s all
    very Midsomer Murders, and extremely weird. Visit with caution.</p>

<p><b>Cafe:</b> You would think the National Trust might open a 1950s-themed outlet on the Ness where Victoria sponge
    cake made
    with radioactive raspberry jam is washed down with dishwater tea, but no, you must return to Orford for
    refreshments. <a href="https://www.riversidetearoomorford.co.uk/">The Riverside Tearoom</a> does superior paninis,
    toasties and cakes.</p>

<h2>Danes Dyke, Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire</h2>

<p>From a car park tucked away in deep woods, you wander down a steep-sided declivity that looks suspiciously man-made.
    It was. But no one knows who did it. Was it built to defend against Scandinavian visitors in horned helmets, or part
    of a bronze age northern powerhouse scheme? Whoever was responsible, they cleverly hid the evidence under woodland
    carpeted with wild garlic and bluebells. Then, quite abruptly, you emerge on a marvellous beach, one entirely made
    up of smooth white stones the majority of which have been pierced by one or two finger-size holes. Ignorant and
    illiterate peasants of yesteryear used to blame witches for this, and call the petrified artefacts hag-stones.
    However, since witches no longer exist, we have no explanation. Baffled scientists stand around, looking baffled.
    Children like to balance them in towers (I mean the stones). Leaving aside superstition, it is a fact that you
    cannot tell a lie when speaking through one of the holes in a hag-stone.
    Cafe: There is a good refreshment kiosk near the car park. Otherwise head for Scrumdiddlyumptious in Flamborough for top-notch cakes.
